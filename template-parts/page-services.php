                   <h2>Get the most out of your solar investment</h2>
                    <p>Do you own (or plan to purchase) an energy storage system? If your home is also equipped with a solar power system, consider integrating the two technologies to maximize your investment. Most residential solar stations only send energy one way—to the electrical grid. With white-glove integration services from a Qmerit certified installer, your energy storage system can fill up on free, clean solar power instead of drawing from the grid.</p>

<p>And just as a generator will spare you the headaches of power outages, Qmerit makes the installation process hassle-free.</p>
